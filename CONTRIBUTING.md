# Contributing to Scumblr

Documentation for Scumblr is available in the Scumblr [wiki]( https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr/wiki )

The Scumblr team is following a very simple branching model.  We use [master](https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr/tree/master) as the production branch, and all other branches are used for features or bugs.  We do not maintain a dev only branch, staging, etc.  

Contributions will be accepted to the [master](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite-manager/tree/dev) only.

## How to provide a patch for a new feature

1. If it is a major feature, please create an [Issue]( https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr/issues ) and discuss it with the project leaders. 

2. If in step 1 you get an acknowledge from the project leaders, use the
   following procedure to submit a patch:

    a. Fork Scumblr on github ( http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ )

    b. Create a topic branch (git checkout -b my_branch)

    c. Push to your branch (git push origin my_branch)

    d. Initiate a pull request on github ( http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/ )

    e. We'll review your pull request and merge when approved!
